The convex optimization problem in the algorithm can be solved by the MATLAB builtin function
lasso() or using CVX solver.

Two Backpropogation algorithms are implemented: itrBackPropagation() and itrBackPropagation2().
Good results can be obtained without using back propogation but use of backpropagation gives
marginally better results.
